# AGENTS.md — `src/summonpot/`

Rules for changing framework source. The root `AGENTS.md` covers workflow and review;
this file covers the code itself.

## Rules that come from real bugs


Every rule below cost a bug. They are not style preferences.

**Never widen an `except`.** A bare `except Exception` around annotation resolution
silently degraded typed endpoints to untyped ones for months. Catch the exact error you
can handle, and let the rest surface.

**Fail at registration, not at request time.** Roughly ten of 0.3.0's changes turned
silently-wrong declarations into errors raised when the pot is imported. A wrong
declaration should never reach traffic. When adding a rule, add it to `summon()`.

**Do not use a name as a proxy for a property.** Rejecting a capability because its
first parameter is called `self` both rejected valid functions and accepted real
unbound methods with a differently-named receiver. Detect the actual property —
`__qualname__` and the owning class, in that case.

**Do not round-trip a type through a string.** `ParamDef.type_annotation` is a display
string and cannot express `int | None` or `list[int]`. Request schemas are built from
the resolved annotation object; anything that parses a type back out of text is a bug
waiting to happen.

**Respect PEP 563.** This codebase uses `from __future__ import annotations`, so
annotations are strings at runtime and a quoted annotation nests. Two consequences that
have each bitten:

- Resolving once is not enough — `"Request"` evaluates to the *string* `Request`.
- `exec` inherits the future flag from the calling module, so a test that means to
  exclude postponed annotations must `compile(..., dont_inherit=True)`. Without it the
  test asserts the opposite of its name and still passes.

**Preserve `Annotated` metadata.** `typing.get_type_hints` defaults to
`include_extras=False`, and a `Query()` in the default position replaces the
`FieldInfo` an annotation already carried. Both silently drop the user's validation
constraints.

**Never put internal detail in a response body.** Model output and provider text can
carry request data. Failures return a fixed public message; the detail goes to the
`summonpot.server` logger.

**Synchronous capabilities run in a worker thread.** They must not capture a
thread-affine resource — a default SQLite connection is the usual trap. This is also
the one breaking change in 0.3.0 that surfaces under traffic rather than at import.

**`functools.wraps` is not enough to describe a capability.** It produces a usable
schema only for a plain function; for a partial or a callable instance it leaves the
provider reading the wrapper's own annotations against the wrong module. Describe the
capability explicitly.

## Reviewing a change

In rough order of what has actually gone wrong here:

- **Does a doc claim something the code does not do?** This project has shipped several
  of these — `stream=True`, "deterministic capabilities", a `method=` that was
  discarded. A claim is a defect.
- **Does a new guard reject valid code?** Every guard added in 0.3.0 needed a
  false-positive test as well as a true-positive one. Two shipped rejecting valid input
  and were caught in review, not by tests.
- **Is the failure at the right time?** Registration beats request time; request time
  beats silence.
- **Does the test fail without the fix?** Assert it. Several tests here have passed for
  the wrong reason — one asserted `"FTER" not in text`, which is also true of `"AFTER"`.
- **Does the response leak anything?** See the rule above.
